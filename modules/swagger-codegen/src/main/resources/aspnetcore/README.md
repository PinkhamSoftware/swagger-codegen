**CSV Generation**

```WebApiContrib.Core.Formatter.Csv``` library has been used to automatically generate CSV data from an ```IEnumerable<T>``` once the ```accept: text/csv``` header is sent in the request. Please refer to [Csv Outputter](https://github.com/damienbod/WebAPIContrib.Core/tree/master/src/WebApiContrib.Core.Formatter.Csv). Please refer to [architectural decision record 1](./ArchitectureDecisionRecords/1-CsvExport.md).
